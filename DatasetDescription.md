# 🚁 UAV AoI Optimization Dataset (`FinalDataset.csv`)

This dataset was used in training both a **Multi-Head Attention (MHA)** model and a **Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG)** algorithm to optimize **Age of Information (AoI)** and **Energy Consumption** in a simulated 3D drone-based IoT system.

## 📚 Feature Description

| 🔢 **Column** | 📌 **Description** |
|--------------|--------------------|
| `droneX`, `droneY`, `droneZ` | 3D coordinates of drone agents representing current drone position |
| `zoneId` | Zone ID (1–8) indicating the drone’s operational area (also used as the drone ID) |
| `IotId` | Unique identifier of each IoT device, used during prioritization |
| `IotX`, `IotY`, `IotZ` | 3D coordinates of IoT devices where drones collect data |
| `Iot Data Generation Time(DateTime)` | Data last generated by an Iot device in DateTime |
| `Iot Data Size(MB)` | Size of the generated data by the IoT device in MB |
| `Application Delay Deadline(Sec)` | The delay to process the data |
| `Drone Remaining Energy(J)` | Remaining energy (in Joules) of each drone agent |
| `Priority` | Final importance level (1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = high) assigned via MHA attention mechanism |

## 🔍 Use Case

This dataset powered both:

- **MHA-based prioritization** of IoT requests
- **MADDPG-based policy learning** for drone control

In the MHA setup

- 🧩 **Input Features**:
  - droneX, droneY, droneZ
  - IotX, IotY, IotZ
  - IotId
  - zoneId
  - IoT Data Generation Time
  - IoT Data Size
  - Processing Delay
                                   
- 🎯 **Output**: Priority score calculated via softmax attention weights and discretized into 3 levels (1–3)

The output priority was then embedded into the final dataset before passing to the MADDPG training stage.

In the MADDPG setup:
- 🎯 **Agents** = Drones
- 📡 **State** = Relative positions, IoT priority, and energy status
- 🏆 **Reward Function** = Balances **AoI freshness** and **energy consumption**

## 🛠 Data Generation Workflow

- 🛉 **Simulation Engine**: Unity3D was used to generate realistic drone-IoT scenarios in 3D space
- 🧠 **MHA Training**: Dataset passed through and trained using MHA
- 📊 **Priority Output**: MHA outputs the `Priority` values, added to the final dataset
- 🤖 **MADDPG Training**: Dataset (with priorities) used for multi-agent training

---

## 🛠 Sample Code

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("FinalDataset.csv")
print(data.head())
```

## 📌 Notes
- Each row represents a **drone-IoT interaction snapshot**
- Values were preprocessed for integration with custom OpenAI Gym environments
- The dataset supports both **MHA** and **MADDPG**
